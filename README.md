Code repository for Rowland-Chandler et al., "Resource diversity begets stability in complex ecosystems".

To access the corresponding data files, please go to...
The code is written assuming the user has the data saved in a folder called "Data" in the same directory as these codes. 

The repository consists of:
- Example notebooks: Jupyter notebooks using the user how to do the following. (These codes are not used in the paper itself.)
	- `Running simulations.ipynb`: Randomly generate a consumer-resource model community, run a simulation, and determine community stability.
	- `Solving self consistency equations.ipynb`: Solve the self-consistency equations for a given parameter set (parameters determining the distribution of model coefficients), and solve for the stability boundary.
- Figures: Code used for generating figures in the Main text and Supplementary information.
	- `eLV_vs_CRM.py`: Main text, figure 4
	- `heterogeneity_vs_stability.py`: Main text, figure 5
- Modules:
- SCEs codes:
- Simulation codes:
